1. Data Partitioning -
   - Create a large array of numbers.
   - Decide on the number of processes one want to use for parallel processing.
   - Divide the array into smaller chunks, with each chunk assigned to a different process.

2. Parallel Processing -
   - Define a function that takes a chunk of the array and calculates the sum.
   - Use the multiprocessing library to create multiple processes, each running the function with its assigned chunk.
   - Each process calculates the sum of its chunk independently.

3. Result Aggregation -
   - Collect the results from each process.
   - Aggregate these results to get the final sum of the entire array.

Regarding Shared Memory and Message Passing -

Shared Memory - In a shared memory system, processes can access the same portion of memory. In this simulation, shared memory would involve passing the entire array to each process, and each process accessing a different portion of the array for computation. However, Python's multiprocessing library typically uses separate memory spaces for each process, so you would need to explicitly share memory using techniques like shared arrays or shared variables if you want to achieve shared memory behavior.

Message Passing - Message passing involves communication between processes by sending messages. While the multiprocessing library provides communication mechanisms like queues and pipes, in this simulation, you're not explicitly passing messages between processes during computation. Each process works independently on its assigned chunk of data without requiring communication with other processes. However, if you were implementing a more complex parallel algorithm where processes needed to exchange data or synchronize their work, you would use message passing techniques like queues or pipes.
